Assessment and Plan: Diabetes. Widely varying BGs that would be best explained by more data and would benefit by better understanding of carbs and influence on sugar. Discussed  "1500" rule.  She has correction factor of 50-60 and insulin to carb ratioj of 1/20 based on current total daily doses. Could try to address Humalog doses using this. Try to keep record of food, bg and insulin.  Needs Anti-Coag appt which will be arranged today.





Follow-up:Dr. Townsend Sept.
