Re:  Brady Duvall

     MR #425-03-15-1

 

Dear Patricia:

 

I saw Brady Duvall again today.  He has been very stable

clinically over these past six months.  I believe this represents

a composite of the following three major changes in his medical

regimen.  As you know, we have discontinued all beta blockers,

and this has been associated with a symptomatic stability.  He

had biventricular pacing box placed, certainly contributing to

his overall improved status and he is now taking a regular dose

of Lasix.  He is on 80 mg alternating with 40 mg per day.  He

does have symptoms of fatigue, but his overall volume status is

quite reasonable.  He is currently on Aldactone 25 mg daily and

Lasix 80 mg per day alternating with 40 mg per day, Captopril

6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d., Zocor, insulin, Glucophage, aspirin, and

mexiletine.  His amiodarone has been discontinued.  He does have

asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, often paced out of this,

but I am reluctant to recommend ablation therapy for him at the

present time.  He has not been shocked by his ICD.

 

Functionally he seems quite stable.  He does have mild fatigue,

but is otherwise reasonably active.  He will hopefully be

traveling to Miami this spring.

 

Physical examination today is of note for a weight of 184 lbs. 

His blood pressure is 118/70, his resting pulse 69.  His neck

veins are in fact, quite unimpressive.  There is minimal jugular

distention, perhaps 6-7 cm.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.

Lungs were clear.  Examination of his heart reveals a quiet

precordium.  S1 and S2 seem normal.  No S3, no gallop and no

murmur or mitral regurgitation.  Abdomen is benign without

palpable liver or spleen and there was no peripheral edema. 

There are bilateral varicosities.

 

His electrocardiogram shows pace rhythm.

 

Mr. Brady Duvall is currently stable on this regimen. 

Accordingly, I have made no changes.  I have checked appropriate

electrolytes.

 

Many thanks for letting us participate in his care.

 

With best regards.

 

Sincerely,

 

 

 

U. L. Dana, M.D.
