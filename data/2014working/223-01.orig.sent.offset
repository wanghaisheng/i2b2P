223-01	67	0	We reviewed the   options which include medical therapy and/or coronary   angiography and possible angioplasty.  I made no solid   recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty   approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead   to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical   therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and   I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of   single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and   only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom   tolerance.	vessel FFF 65 65	 FFF 	 FFF 	 FFF 	 FFF 	 FFF 	narrative
