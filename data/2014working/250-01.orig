RE:  Urania Yerger

     MR #583-48-90-0

 

Dear Dr. Dillon:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today for the first

time in Titonka Care Center in follow-up of her

coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting in

October of this year.  Though you know her history well, I will

recount it for the purposes of record keeping.  Ms. Yerger is

presently 81 years old.  Her vascular risk factors include

diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  She had no prior diagnosis

of coronary disease until she presented in early October with flash

pulmonary edema after which she ruled in for a small non-ST

elevation myocardial infarction.  Coronary angiography at the

Titonka revealed complex diffuse disease of the proximal LAD,

thrombotic lesion of the proximal circumflex with subsequent

complete occlusion and a complex lesion of the first large marginal

as well as a 70% osteal stenosis of a large PLV.  Angiography also

revealed a 90% left renal artery stenosis.  The patient underwent

subsequent successful stenting of her right renal artery followed

by coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Susan Abreu.  (SVG to

ramus, OM2, RCA, and LIMA to LAD).  Ms. Yerger's postoperative

course was notable for persistent pleural effusion and transient

episode of atrial fibrillation.  

 

Since her discharge, she has been slowly increasing her level of

activity experiencing mild dyspnea on exertion while on extending

shopping trips.  Overall, these symptoms have continued to improve. 

She denies orthopnea, PND, or shortness of breath at rest.  She has

had persistent mild ankle edema on the site of her saphenous vein

graft harvesting.  She denies palpitations, presyncope, TIA, CVA

symptoms or claudication.  

 

Detailed review of all other pertinent systems is negative.  Ms.

Yerger tells me that she has recently had an erythematous rash on

her upper and lower extremities that you have been managing as a

possible viral exanthem.

Past medical history is notable for chronic renal insufficiency

(baseline creatinine 2), vascular risk factors as delineated and

prior right knee replacement.  

 

Her current medications include enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.

day, Lasix 40 mg po q. day, Glipizide 10 mg po q. day, Lisinopril

5 mg po q. day, Lopressor 25 mg po t.i.d., atorvastatin 10 mg po q.

day, Avandia, multivitamins, Protonix and Nystatin cream.

 

Social History:  The patient lives alone but has many family

members in the area.  She is currently staying with her daughter. 

At baseline, she has been able to ambulate slowly with a cane but

is limited by chronic knee pain.  She denies alcohol or tobacco

use.  Her father died of a myocardial infarction at age 60.

 

On physical exam, Ms. Yerger looks extremely well today.  She is

comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her skin is warm and dry. 

She has a diffuse erythematous macular papular rash predominantly

on her extremities.  Her blood pressure is 140/80, her heart rate

is in the 70's.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her

carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Her chest reveals decreased breath

sounds at the left base.  There are no crackles or wheezes. 

Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and

rhythm, S1, S2 and S4 is present and P2 is slightly increased. 

There was a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur radiating toward the

apex.  Her abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her extremities are free

of cyanosis or clubbing.  Distal pulses are 1+.  She has mild edema

of the left lower extremity.

 

Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm 79 beats per minute, normal axis and

intervals, persistent deep anterior T wave inversions.

 

Overall, Ms. Yerger continues on a steady course of recovery after

her non-ST elevation MI and coronary artery bypass grafting in mid

October.  Her persistent dyspnea on exertion may be related to

persistent pleural effusion.  We will reevaluate today with a

repeat chest x-ray.  In the meantime, I think that we should

continue her oral diuretic regimen.  It is possible that her

persistent rash is related to her Lasix.  Although not certain to

be successful, we have made a change to Bumex 1 mg po q. day today

in the hopes that if Lasix is responsible for her rash this may

resolve.  I have made no other changes to her medical regimen.  We

will continue aspirin, beta blockade, ACE inhibition and statin for

secondary prevention.  I look forward to seeing her again in

approximately eight to twelve weeks.  In addition, she will follow-

up with Dr. Abreu for possible thoracentesis if she has a

persistent pleural effusion that may be contributing to her

symptoms.

It is a pleasure being involved in Ms. Yerger's care.  Please do

not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

 

Sincerely yours,
