RE:  Peter Joshi

     MR #453-39-84-4

 

Dear Dr. Craft:

 

I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th.  Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint

of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.  The patient does relate that

he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly

worse several years ago.  However, with the treatment of his

coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until

he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.  Since that

surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time

during which he has required supplemental oxygen.  At the same

time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure

and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing

Lasix.  The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he

did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician

did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.  At the current time,

Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is

able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several

months ago.  In fact, he was told recently that he does not need

supplemental oxygen.  He denies a chronic cough, although he does

occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to

coughing.

 

His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery

stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent

placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,

hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and

upper GI bleed.

His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,

Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,

potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.

 

He has no known drug allergies.  He discontinued cigarette

smoking years ago.

 

On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.  His pulse was

56, afebrile.  O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when

I rechecked it, it was 95%.  His weight was 221 lbs.  He is in no

respiratory distress at rest.  His oropharynx had dry mucosa and

a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.  His neck had no

enlarged lymph nodes.  Chest had diminished breath sounds in the

left base with crackles.  His right lung was clear.  His heart

was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic

murmur.  His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.  His

extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.  Pulmonary

function testing had been performed in December and was repeated

again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined

restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.  His current

vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of

December.  He has no bronchodilator response.  I took Mr. Joshi

for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that

includes after walking up one flight of stairs.

 

In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely

mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning. 

However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on

my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred

him to have a decubitus chest film taken.  Mr. Joshi had several

questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have

recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.  I do

not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled

corticosteroid for this gentleman.  I do recommend that he get

daily exercise.  He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and

I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that

he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.  I have also

confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen. 

His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced

defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for

albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely

to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary

vascular disease.  However, we will certainly reassess this after

his initial work-up.  Thank you for referring this interesting

patient.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to

call.

 

 

 

Sincerely,
