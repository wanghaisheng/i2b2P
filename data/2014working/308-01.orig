Record date: 2074-06-05

Mills returns with Urquiza and her husband.  He's been trying - cut way back on sodas, and chips.  He walks every day - really no complaints.  His HbA1C was up at 9.2.   No proteinuria.  No complaints of foot numbness , no visual sx.    Lipids were fair - 202, HDL 44, Trigs 461.  Cost has become an issue on meds as Mills has been denied state insurance for arcane reasons..  (his income is only 850.00/mo)
