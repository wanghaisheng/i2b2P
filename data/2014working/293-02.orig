Cora Quinley

MR# 759-87-55-2

March 3, 2077

 

As the responsible teaching attending, I can confirm both the

history and physical examination of Dr. Uriel Zapien. Briefly, the

patient is a 71-year-old female with several cardiovascular risk

factors. She was admitted to the hospital in January after a

prolonged episode of palpitations. The patient had a tiny

Troponin  elevation to 0.3, and the decision was made to manage

her conservatively. The patient continues to have these episodes

of palpitations, but she does not get chest pain with any

exercise.

 

Her current medical regimen includes aspirin, beta-blocker,

statin and an ACE Inhibitor. 

 

On physical examination she has 2+ carotids, which have normal

upstrokes and no bruits. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her

heart examination reveals a regular rate with a normal S1 and S2,

without S3 and S4.

 

Her electrocardiogram is normal.

 

Assessment: I concur with Dr. Zapien in that we will increase the

patient's beta-blockers to decrease her probable supraventricular

tachycardia. She will be seen back here in several months.
