HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman with type I diabetes who comes in today for followup.  We have had heron the insulin pump now for close to six months and recently she had had continuous blood glucose monitoring.  We had gone over these results over the phone and I had made some adjustments.  Particularly she seems to have some late morning hyperglycemia and we decided to change her carbohydrate to bolus ratio during the morning hours and this has resulted in tremendous improvement in her blood sugars.  She brings them in today and the results look excellent.  She has had no other concerns of late.  We have not tested her hemoglobin A1c in a long period of time, so she comes in today for further evaluation.
