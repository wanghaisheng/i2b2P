Vascular:	No claudication.

Past Medical History:

Family History: 
Wendee has been profiled in the media because of her work as an industrial engineer 

Social History: 
Jake is well. His parents have been ill. 

Review of Systems: above
Psych: Referred to urologist at KJH, Dr. Xayachack (? sp) because of absent libido. He made the switch from Celexa to Wellbutrin and added Androgel and DHEA. She has noted more acne or no more libido. The loss of libido precedes the Celexa and the possibility of its relationship to Neoral or CellCept has been raised. 
She sees her gynecologist regularly.

Impressions and Plan:	
Hard to assess control without data. Hopefully her weight loss does not reflect terrible control.
BP much too high. Start Toprol 25 mg qd.
I have no objection to switch to simvastatin from atorvastatin for  cost reasons, but she must check with the transplant MDs re: this switch because of Neoral interaction with statins.
Her chest pain does not sound particularly cardiac but will ask Dr. Dotson whether he wants any further evaluation. 
MUST     see Dr. Aragon, see transplant MD. Make these appointments for her today.
Will get barium swallow because of her dysphagia - ? disorganized esophageal contractions; consider manometry with Dr. Quam.
A1c, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, Ca, P, A/G, 25-(OH) vitamin D, PTH, CBC, urinalysis. Has already taken her Neoral today.
