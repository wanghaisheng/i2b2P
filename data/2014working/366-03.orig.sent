HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Ferrara returns for followup visit.  She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm.  Postoperatively, she did well, although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving.  She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm.  According to the patient, this was present early during her hospitalization, but because of other issues, it was not paid very much attention.  She denies any significant pain in the leg.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she appears generally well.  
The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma, whatsoever.  
The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses; however, she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition.
