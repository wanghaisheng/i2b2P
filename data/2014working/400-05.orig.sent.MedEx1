400-05||88||Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.
400-05||89||She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.   ##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.
400-05||90||Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.   A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.  Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.  Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.  Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.||DIN FFF antipsychotics.
