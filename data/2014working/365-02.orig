CC: burn to R foot
HPI: 
44yo diabetic M with peripheral neuropathy, fell asleep in front of space heater approximately 3 weeks ago and noted swelling/blisters at tips of R 1st-3rd toes upon waking.  His wounds have been managed until this time by his podiatrist and his mother (a former doctor) has been doing dressing changes at home- initially with silvadene but over the past several days with ?betadine as directed by his podiatrist.  The pt is a floor covering installer, and has been bearing weight on the R foot since his injury and admits that he has not been compliant wearing a heel boot.  He has not had fever/chills, nausea/emesis and in general feels well.  He has not had pain in the foot, but does have a significant neuropathy.  His podiatrist recommended that he be evaluated by plastic/burn surgery and he presents to burn clinic for further evaluation.
