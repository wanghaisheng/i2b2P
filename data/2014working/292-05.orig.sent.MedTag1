292-05||9||Dear Dr. Nall:

292-05||15||He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents.||DRT FFF until FFF 3 3||INDICATION FFF unstable angina FFF 9 10||
292-05||16||He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis.||INDICATION FFF mm FFF 13 13||INDICATION FFF cypher stent FFF 14 15||DIN FFF atm FFF 20 20||INDICATION FFF mm FFF 28 28||INDICATION FFF stenosis.

292-05||24||Nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P2Y12 PRU assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.
