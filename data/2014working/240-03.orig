	Reason for visit:

   chest pain



	Interval History:

   Cardiologist:  Hall



Mr. Innis is a 77 y/o man with h/o CAD s/p LAD stenting (Taxus Express 3.0x16mm) in 3/95.  All other vessels had only minimal irregularities.  Since that time, he has had only mild chest discomfort which is always relieved with nitroglycerin.  



This morning, he had a more severe episode of chest pain accompanied by SOB and diaphoresis that started when walking to the dock after starting his boat.  The pain was primarily in his back, similar to his angina prior to stenting.  The pain lasted for approximately 30 min despite SL NTG, although did go away eventually.  He had diaphoresis, SOB, and blurred vision associated with the pain.  He was brought to the ED by his family.  On arrival, he was pain free. P 60 BP 110/70.  He was treated with ASA and Lopressor.  EKG was unremarkable.  Two sets of markers were negative.  He is admitted to complete rule out MI and further diagnostic testing.



He currently denies pain and feels back to his baseline.  He denies orthopnea, PND, LE swelling, + occasional palpitations, no syncope/near syncope.
