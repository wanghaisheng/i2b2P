80 yo man with CAD, anemia, and the chief complaint of buttock pain with ambulation.



He has had some pain in his buttocks when he ambulates a short distance which resolves with standing still. Hip films were unremarkable. No calf pains. He saw Dr. Jaimes for a second opinion and was advised to exercise more and cut down on alcohol. He has had some anemia and his GI w/u at Fairfield was negative. I then started him on Coumadin which he finally started taking.

================ Problems ================

BUTTOCK PAIN   With ambulation. Probably spinal stenosis but I will check some vascular studies.



ANEMIA    GI w/u at Fairfield was negative. I referred him to Dr. Emmons in Hematology today.

         

HYPERTENSION   Did not take meds today.

         

DIABETES (FOLLOWED AT CLAIBORNE)     Brings an A1C of 6.1. Continue Actos and Glucotrol.

     

PROSTATE CA        Stable.



ALCOHOL   Reiterate the importance of keeping limit on alcohol.



AF  I am relieved that he has finally agreed to start the Coumadin.



CAD  Doing well after angioplasty.



PATIENT/PHYSICIAN  He has wanted to see Dr. Jaimes in Cardiology. I explained to him that I am a cardiologist as well and that I have found in the past it does not work out well to have two cardiologists involved in his care. I think Dr. Jaimes is a superb cardiologist and I gave him the number for GCH teleservices to find himself a new internist. He clearly is somewhat conflicted about this and will think about it.
