who presents after mechanical trip and follow at work today and

hit her forehead.  No loss of consciousness, no headache, no

visual changes, no upper or lower extremities, paresthesias or

pain at that area.  No focal weakness, no neck pain, no back

pain, no chest pain, shortness of breath, no belly pain.

shoulder that is held by her side, she has exquisite tenderness,

unable to really move it.  She has intact axillary nerve

sensation, full strength in her hand and fingers.  Alert and

oriented x3.  Normal mood and affect.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient thought she hit her

forehead does not have signs or symptoms suggestive of

intracerebral injuries.  I do not feel she needs imaging though

she has pain in her shoulder.  She is awake and alert and answers

questions appropriately.  She has no cervical spine tenderness in

the midline.  She did have plain films of her right shoulder that

show comminuted fracture of the right humerus involving the

surgical neck, greater tuberosity, anatomic neck with medial

displacement distal fragment.  She also had a chest x-ray that

showed some mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The patient had

preoperative screening labs that included sodium 138, K 4.2,

The patient will be admitted to the Orthopedics Surgery.  We will

check UA given her white count.  Of note, she did have her

differential still pending.

which is also another diagnosis.
