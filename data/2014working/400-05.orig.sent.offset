Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.  Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.  Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.	na FFF 67 67	0gm FFF 69 69	 FFF 	 FFF 	while regular coke contains 45mg na FFF 71 76	 FFF 	narrative
