1.  Basal cell carcinoma.  Status post recent excision.



2.  CAD.  Patient hospitalized at Atlantic North Rehabilitation in mid-December after apparently experiencing some chest pain and being found to have an abnormal EKG.  He apparently had cardiac catheterization and an initial stent was placed, following this he had a stress test which showed some  continued changes and a second catheterization showed a second blocked vessel and a second stent was placed.  Medical regimen was adjusted.  I do not have any further details of this hospitalization and the above details are based on patient history.  He was started on Coumadin which she was told he would have to take for a limited period.  This is monitored from the ANRC.



3.  Diabetes.  Last HgbA1c was in October and was 7.7 which is a moderate improvement for him.  Reports compliance with his regimen.
