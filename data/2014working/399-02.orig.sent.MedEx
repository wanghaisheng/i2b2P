399-02	20	The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.		 
399-02	21	This may represent abscess.		 
399-02	22	Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.
