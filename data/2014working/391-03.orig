Reason for visit:  Patient is a 59 year old woman seen today together with Dr. Barajas.

MEDICATIONS:  She is currently on atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 50 mg q.d., Zestril 20 mg q.d.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 150/80 with a pulse of 76.  

PLAN:  
1.	I would increase her atenolol to 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the late afternoon.
2.	Diabetes is in suboptimal control, despite maximum dose Micronase.  Creatinine of 1.4 would argue against using Glucophage.  Check hemoglobin A1C and then we will decide on her medication.
