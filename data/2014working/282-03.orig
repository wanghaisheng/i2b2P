Re:  Peter Joshi

MR #45339844

 

Dear Dr. Hodges:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Hospital Regional Universitario.  This lovely gentleman with ischemic heart disease and 

congestive heart

failure has been followed in our clinic since the time of his carotid 

endarterectomy and cardiac

procedure.  At the present time, he notes that he has been very minimally 

active because of the

flooding.  He has had no paroxysms of chest discomfort.  He has had no exertional 

neck, chest, arm

or jaw pain.  He has had dyspnea on exertion at greater than 4 METS of 

activity and he does

have mild lower extremity edema.

 

His medical regimen includes aspirin, Demadex, isosorbide, Lopressor, 

simvastatin, Norvasc,

Prevacid, multivitamins, potassium chloride and insulin.  

 

On physical examination, his weight is 223 pounds.  His blood pressure is 

124/60 right and left

arm seated.  His heart rate is 54 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 10.  

There is a mild increase in

jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without bruits.  Lungs are actually 

clear to auscultation

throughout.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for a systolic ejection murmur 

but no gallop is

present.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.  

Extremities are

notable for symmetric pulses somewhat diminished at the level of the 

posterior tibialis and mild

pitting edema to the midshin bilaterally.  

 

His electrocardiogram is sinus bradycardia with inverted T waves in I and L.  

No significant

change from prior electrocardiograms.

 

In summary, Patrick Joshi looks like he is in mild volume overload at the 

present time.  He reports

that he has had renal insufficiency in the past.  Before adjusting his 

Demadex dosing, I will

reassess his kidney profile.

If there are any other thoughts or questions in the care of this lovely 

gentleman, please feel free

Sincerely,
