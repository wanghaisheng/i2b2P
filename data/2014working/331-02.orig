Mr. Sparks is a 74 yr. M who was seen by me as a new patient in Nov. 10 and again in Dec. 10. He RTC.



HPI: This visit was supposed to be a preoperative visit prior to his scheduled Feb. 02 right inguinal hernia repair with Dr. Yamaguchi. However, when I saw him in Dec he had inadequate BP control despite Dr. Arias doubling his Lisinopril. I DCed Atenolol and switched him to Labetalol 100 mg BID. Despite some confusion I believe he has done this. He had also been switched from Crestor to Lipitor due to safety concerns. Labs done pre-operatively are notable for:

Creatinine     3.4

LDL          184

nct.           35%

Hypertension 

Hyperlipidemia 

Anemia

LN: No palpable neck or SC LN;

Cardiac: RRR, rate 72, no extra sounds

Resp.: good air movement, no accessory muscle use, no adventitious sounds



Plan:

1. Hypertension: continues to be inadequate in a diabetic.We have limited options; increasing Lisinopril did not add much. Switch to Labetalol did not help, but he is also not beta-blocked (HR 72) so I am increasing Labetalol to 200 mg BID.

2. Diabetes: control has been good.

3. Renal insufficiency

4. Hyperlipidemia: we may need to increase Lipitor and/or add Zetia.

5. Right inguinal hernia: RTC one week for hopefully better pre-op. BP
